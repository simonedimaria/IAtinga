# IAtinga

The first artificial not-so-intelligente

## Description

In the landscape of IoT, the company [**IOTinga**](https://www.iotinga.it/) (they paid me for this) decided to surprise everyone with a proprietary AI model: **IAtinga**. Originally intended for internal use, IAtinga was later presented to the public. However, people quickly realized that IOTinga's artificial intelligence was designed according to **their own "intelligence" standards**, resulting in widespread disinterest. IAtinga can send and receive information about various topics, such as water coolers or window blinds, but its unique design failed to capture public attention.

## Objective

The challenge takes place in two steps within everyone's reach: to complete the first step you will have to talk to IAtinga while for the second step, well, solve the first first

## Skills Required

* HTTP requests interception via proxy tools, e.g., Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP

* Basic understanding of machine learning language models

## Have fun!
